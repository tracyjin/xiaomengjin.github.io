Hi, I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student from University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. My research focuses on enhancing the performance and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) through advanced data synthesis strategies, such as adversarial attacks, data augmentation, and schema induction. I am also interested in improving the adaptability and reliability of LLMs using diverse approaches including retrieval-augmented generation and machine unlearning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Heng Ji. Before that, I received my Bachelor degree at University of Toronto, and then my Master degree at Stanford University. You can find my CV here.
